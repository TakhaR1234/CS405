# CS-405: Secure Coding
# Overview
This project focuses on secure software development practices using C++. The original encryption/decryption code was analyzed, and enhancements were made to improve functionality, input validation, and security.

# Files Included
-CS405.cpp – Original encryption/decryption module.

-Enhanced_CS405.cpp – Improved and secure version of the program.

# Enhancements Made
-Added comprehensive input validation and error handling.

-Implemented safer coding practices (avoiding unsafe string operations).

-Added comments to clarify program logic.

-Improved encryption/decryption structure for maintainability.

# Skills Demonstrated
-Secure coding principles.

-Data validation and error handling.

-C++ programming best practices.

-Debugging and program testing.

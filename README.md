# CS-405: Secure Coding

## Overview
This project focuses on secure software development practices using C++. The original encryption code was analyzed, and enhancements were made to improve functionality, input validation, and security handling.

## Files Included
- `CS405.cpp`: Enhanced encryption/decryption module

## Enhancements Made
- Improved input validation and error handling
- Added comments to clarify logic
- Used safer coding practices (e.g., avoiding unsafe string operations)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Secure coding principles
- Data validation
- C++ programming and debugging
